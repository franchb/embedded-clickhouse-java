## Security Considerations

When using this library, please keep the following in mind:

1. **Network Access**: The library downloads ClickHouse binaries from official sources. Ensure your environment allows outbound HTTPS connections to ClickHouse download servers.

2. **Binary Verification**: Downloaded binaries are verified via SHA-512 checksums and cached locally. Review the cache directory permissions (`~/.cache/embedded-clickhouse` by default).

3. **Test Environments Only**: This library is designed for testing. Do not use embedded ClickHouse instances in production.

4. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update your dependencies to pick up security fixes.
